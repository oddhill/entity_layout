# Entity layout

This module allows you to create default layouts for configuration entities that supports field UI.

This module also supports layout on the content entity level. This means that you can have a default configuration but then also override it for individual content. This will allow your site editors to layout nodes, taxonomy terms etc. without interfering with the default layout saved as configuration.

**NOTE!**

This module is still in development and major changes may occur. Use at your own risk.
